## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- Support for Phoenix LiveView 1.x (#24)

  Dependency specs have been updated to allow LiveView 1.x usage. GitHub Actions matrix has been updated to include Elixir >= 1.14, OTP >= 26, Phoenix >= 1.6 and LiveView >= 0.20 (going forward, < 1.x will be dropped).
- Support for automatic inference of action names from controller and LiveView routes (#28).

  Thanks to this, actions corresponding to controller actions and `:live_action` no longer have to be defined explicitly in the actions module. Example:
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Actions do
    # Merge the actions from the router into the default grouping schema.
    use Permit.Phoenix.Actions, router: MyAppWeb.Router
  end
  ```

- Add option to use streams instead of assigns (d6e2d2d).

  The `use_stream?/1` callback (and `:use_stream?` option key) was added to `Permit.Phoenix.LiveView`, defaulting to `false`. When set to `true`, it directs Permit.Phoenix to insert the loaded-and-authorized resources as the `:loaded_resources` stream, as opposed to an assign key, if dealing with a plural (e.g. `:index`) action. Example:
  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.SomethingLive do
    use Permit.Phoenix.LiveView,
      authorization_module: MyApp.Authorization,
      resource_module: Something,
      use_stream?: true

    # Alternatively use callback with socket argument
    @impl true
    def use_stream?(%{assigns: %{live_action: _}} = _socket) do
      # Logic dependent on socket, e.g. taken from :live_action
      true
    end

    @impl true
    def handle_params(_params, _url, socket) do
      # The :loaded_resources stream is accessible
      {:noreply, socket}
    end
  end
  ```
